    "Author": "Tom Percival",
    "Brief Synopsis": "This brilliantly illustrated story stands out for helping kids visualize anxiety and see how it grows. While playing at the park, Ruby discovers a worry — it’s depicted as a yellow blob with googly eyes that starts out small but gets bigger and bigger. Eventually, it stops her from doing the things she loves and she can’t stop thinking about it. But when she sees a boy sitting on a park bench next to a worry of his own, she starts to talk to him. Then both of their worries begin to fade. “Kids can easily identify with the images and simple storyline,” says an expert from the Child Mind Institute. Another notes that the story helps kids realize that everyone worries sometimes and encourages them to talk about their feelings.",
